                  Electricity generation is the amount of electricity a generator produces during a 
                  specific period of time (1 year here). It is generally measured 
                  in GWh or TWh. The map above shows the generation of electricity in TWh by the countries
                  worldwide. A deeper dive to the sources of electricity these countries use is shown by
                  the line chart beneath the map. <br>A specific country can be selected by clicking the map, 
                  which will aggregate the line chart to show the data for the particular country.

                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>
                  China and the USA continues to be the leaders in electrical generation throughout
                  the years, with India trailing in a distant 3rd. However, information on Russia's
                  electrical generation is unavailable thus actual rankings might be different.
                  <br><br>
                  We can see that coal, gas, and hydro are the leading sources of electricity. 
                  Recently there has been a steady rise of solar and wind, as we aim towards a more 
                  sustainable and green energy option. However, past fascinations with nuclear-based 
                  electricity have been abandoned due to cost-effectiveness.

              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Electricity generation capacity is the maximum electric output an electricity 
                generator can produce under specific conditions. Capacity is generally measured 
                in gigawatts(GW). To put into perspective, one gigawatt is enough energy to power 
                about 750,000 homes. 
                <br><br>The pie chart on the left shows a breakdown of capacity shared
                by continents worldwide. Asia, Europe, and North America hold the most electricity
                , with Asia almost responsible for half of the worldwide capacity by 2020.</p>

              <h2>Capacity Distribution</h2>
              <p>Capacity represents the maximum nameplate output for different fuel types in a country. 
                The area chart to the right represents the distribution of fuel capacity based on fuel 
                types. The trend here mirrors the generation of electricity from these sources. Coal, gas,
                and hydro takes up most of the capacity to accomodate for their major contribution to 
                worldwide electrical generation.</p>

              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                All electricity generation technologies emit greenhouse gases at some point in their 
                life-cycle. As the biggest contributor to CO2 emissions, the burning of fossil fuel 
                have been a main topic in the conservation of the planet. 
                <br><br>
                The steam graph to the right 
                shows the share of emission created from different sources of electricity around the world.
                Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent or MTCO2e is the unit of measurement in this graph. 
                The unit "CO2e" represents an amount of a GHG whose atmospheric impact has been standardized 
                to that of one unit mass of carbon dioxide (CO2), based on the global warming potential (GWP) 
                of the gas.</p>

                The bar to the right shows the evergrowing electrical generation and
                CO2 emissions, which both mirror the same upward trend. Although the world 
                is shifting to renewable power, it is still aparent that our efforts
                have not mitigated the increase in CO2 emission from energy generation.</p>
